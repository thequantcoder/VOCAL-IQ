# BUILD-LOG.md — Running Build Journal

Claude appends one entry per day **after** pushing (see `GIT-WORKFLOW.md`). This is the project's memory: decisions, deviations, deferrals, and what the admin must do next. Never delete entries; only append.

> Also log here any deviation from `TECH-STACK.md` (version bumps, swapped libraries) with the reason, and any feature intentionally deferred.

## Day 00 — Repo Scaffold & Monorepo Foundation — 2026-06-24
Model: Opus
Commits: `chore: scaffold VocalIQ monorepo (Day 0)`
Built:
- Turborepo + pnpm workspaces monorepo at repo root (`package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `turbo.json` with dev/build/lint/typecheck/test).
- `packages/config` (base tsconfig [strict + noUncheckedIndexedAccess + exactOptionalPropertyTypes], Biome config, Tailwind preset seeding design tokens).
- `packages/shared` (Zod fail-fast `parseEnv`, typed error model, core enums, `UsageRecord`/`CostBreakdown`) + 3 passing unit tests.
- `packages/db`, `packages/provider-router` (typed LLM/TTS/STT/Telephony contracts + RouteRequest/UsageMeter), `packages/ui` (`cn` helper + brand tokens) — stubs per ARCHITECTURE.md.
- `apps/api` (NestJS `/healthz`, env-validated boot), `apps/web` (Next 15 + Tailwind v4, branded landing + `/api/health`), `apps/voice` (FastAPI `/healthz` + pyproject + pytest), `apps/workers` (BullMQ boot stub).
- `.gitignore`, `.env.example` (Group A–B names only), root `README.md`, kit copied into `docs/`, `infra/docker-compose.yml` + `.github/workflows/ci.yml` placeholders (real CI = Day 1).
Verification: `pnpm lint` 9/9, `pnpm typecheck` 9/9, `pnpm test` 3/3, `pnpm build` 7/7 all green; voice `pytest` 1/1 green; api `/healthz`, web `/api/health`, voice `/healthz` all return `{"status":"ok"}`.
Decisions / trade-offs:
- Build with `tsc` per-package (not nest-cli/tsup) for a uniform, dependency-light Day-0 toolchain.
- `packages/ui` ships only `cn` + tokens at Day 0 (no JSX components yet) — full library + Waveform are Day 1 per DESIGN-SYSTEM.md.
- Voice service lives outside the pnpm workspace (Python); verified via its own venv + pytest.
Migrations added: none (Prisma schema is Day 4).
Env / secrets added: none committed (`.env.example` lists names only; no `.env` in repo).
**Deviations from TECH-STACK (machine toolchain newer than pinned majors — logged per CLAUDE.md §4):**
- Node **v24** (pinned 20 LTS), pnpm **10.33** (pinned 9.x), Python **3.14** (pinned 3.12). All non-blocking; everything green. Engines set `node>=20`/`pnpm>=9`; CI pins Node 20 / Python 3.12 for parity. **Watch item:** Python 3.14 vs 3.12 may affect voice deps (Pipecat/LiveKit wheels) on Days 7–9 — consider installing Python 3.12 before then.
- pnpm 10 blocks postinstall scripts by default → added `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` allowlist (biome, esbuild, @nestjs/core, sharp, msgpackr-extract).
Deferred (with reason): real CI pipeline, full docker dev stack (Postgres+timescale+pgvector+Redis+LiveKit), full UI token system + Waveform — all scheduled for Day 1.
Admin actions needed next: Day 1 none required (Sentry/PostHog optional). Day 3 Clerk keys; Day 4 `DATABASE_URL`/`DIRECT_URL` + base-currency/plan-tier decision; Day 6 `OPENAI_API_KEY`/`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
Self-audit: passed (A–K) — open items: none.
Proactive suggestions raised: install Python 3.12 before Day 7; add `.nvmrc`/`.node-version` (20) on Day 1 to align local Node with CI.

## Day 01 — CI/CD, Docker Dev Stack & Base Config — 2026-06-25
Model: Opus (Sonnet-recommended day; ran on Opus)
Commits: `c7ff732` feat(ui) design system · `76c8fe9` feat(web,api) app shell + observability · `fb3842c` ci pipeline + docker stack
Built:
- **Design system (DESIGN-SYSTEM.md foundation, not shadcn defaults):** full token system in `apps/web/app/globals.css` via Tailwind v4 `@theme inline` — brand palette, semantic surfaces, radii, spacing, motion vars — with **dark (default) + light** themes flipping semantic vars. `@source` makes the web build scan `packages/ui` so its utilities generate.
- **`packages/ui` re-skinned components:** `Button` (4 variants/3 sizes, press micro-scale, focus-ring grow), `Card` (+Header/Title/Description/Content), `Input` (invalid + mono modes), and the **signature `Waveform`** — deterministic heights/delays (SSR-safe, no hydration flicker), violet default / cyan `live` gradient, `prefers-reduced-motion` static fallback. Framework-agnostic motif CSS shipped as `@vocaliq/ui/styles.css`. Package now builds JSX (`jsx: react-jsx`, React peer dep).
- **Web app shell:** `next-themes` dark-first provider + theme toggle; display/body/mono font pairing (`next/font`); design-system proof page rendering the components + waveform in both themes.
- **Observability (no-op without keys):** Sentry via native Next instrumentation (`instrumentation.ts` + `-client.ts` + server/edge configs) and PostHog client init for web; `observability.ts` (Sentry-before-Nest + lazy PostHog + graceful shutdown flush) for api. Env schema + `.env.example` gained `SENTRY_DSN`/`POSTHOG_*`/`NEXT_PUBLIC_*`.
- **CI gate (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):** `node` job (typecheck → lint → test with Postgres+Redis **service containers** + extension priming → build), `voice` job (**pyright** + ruff + pytest, Python 3.12), `security` job (**gitleaks**). Concurrency-cancel + `permissions: contents: read`.
- **Docker dev stack (`infra/docker-compose.yml`):** Postgres 16 (timescaledb+pgvector via `infra/db/init/00-extensions.sql`), Redis 7, **LiveKit** dev server; healthchecks; **env-overridable host ports**. Scripts `pnpm dev:infra` / `:down` / `:reset`. Node pinned via `.nvmrc`/`.node-version` (20).
Verification:
- `pnpm typecheck` 9/9, `pnpm lint` 9/9, `pnpm test` 3/3, `pnpm build` 7/7 green; voice `pyright` 0 errors, `ruff` clean, `pytest` 1/1.
- **CI gate proven red** on an injected failing spec, then reverted.
- **Docker stack demonstrated:** all 3 containers healthy — `timescaledb 2.28.1` + `vector 0.8.3` enabled, redis `PONG`, livekit HTTP `200`. Web served at `:3100` → 200, waveform bars rendered, `/api/health` ok.
Decisions / trade-offs:
- Tailwind v4 is CSS-first: canonical tokens live in web `globals.css` (`@theme inline`) so semantic colors stay theme-reactive; the Day-0 `tailwind.preset.ts` is retained as a values reference. One app consumes `packages/ui` today; a shared `@vocaliq/ui/styles.css` is already exported for the second consumer.
- **Display face:** "Clash/General Sans" aren't on Google Fonts → substituted **Space Grotesk** (geometric, characterful) per DESIGN-SYSTEM §2; never Inter-as-display.
- **Waveform** uses CSS-keyframe ambient motion (SSR-safe, dependency-light, reduced-motion friendly); the amplitude-reactive Framer version lands with the live-call view (Day 14).
- `@sentry/cli`/`core-js` postinstall scripts left un-allowlisted (not needed without source-map upload), keeping the build-scripts allowlist tight.
- Host ports made env-overridable after finding local 5432/6379 already taken by another project — VocalIQ defaults stay 5432/6379/7880 (match `DATABASE_URL`); no other project disturbed.
Migrations added: none (Prisma schema is Day 4; init SQL only primes local-dev extensions).
Env / secrets added: `SENTRY_DSN`, `POSTHOG_KEY`, `POSTHOG_HOST`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST` (all optional); dev infra `POSTGRES_PORT`/`REDIS_PORT`/`LIVEKIT_PORT` (names only).
Deviations from TECH-STACK: none (versions within pinned majors). `@sentry/nextjs` v8 `captureRouterTransitionStart` is v9-only → omitted.
Deferred (with reason): Trivy/Grype container image scan + Dependabot — no images are built/pushed yet (Phase 4+); Storybook + visual-regression — first real component screens land Day 14+. Both noted per GIT-WORKFLOW CI-gate roadmap.
Admin actions needed next: **`workflow` scope** must be added to the GitHub token before the day branch (which touches `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) can push — see report. Day 3 Clerk keys; Day 4 `DATABASE_URL`/`DIRECT_URL` + base-currency/plan-tier decision; Day 6 `OPENAI_API_KEY`/`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

## Self-Audit — Day 01 (CI/CD, Docker Dev Stack & Base Config)
A. Correctness: ✅ — DoD met: CI runs all stages (TS+Python); docker compose gives working Postgres(+ext)+Redis+LiveKit (verified); tokens + 3 base components + Waveform render light & dark; Sentry/PostHog no-op cleanly. Manual: brought the stack up, queried `pg_extension`, served the web page.
B. Tenancy: ✅ NA — no data access/tables this day (RLS begins Day 4).
C. Security: ✅ — no secrets committed (names-only `.env.example`); optional observability degrades to off; gitleaks added to CI; CI `permissions` least-privilege; LiveKit `--dev` creds are local-only and documented as such.
D. Cost/router: ✅ NA — no provider calls (router core is Day 6–7).
E. Tests: ✅ — 3 unit (shared) green; voice pytest 1 green; the gate was proven to fail on a broken spec. No new app logic needed bespoke tests today.
F. Performance: ✅ — CI uses pnpm + pip caches and concurrency-cancel; fonts subsetted via next/font; no hot paths introduced.
G. Errors/obs: ✅ — Sentry wired for web (all runtimes) + api with shutdown flush; no silent catches added.
H. UI: ✅ — identity applied (palette, display/mono faces, waveform motif), not stock shadcn; dark+light both correct; focus-visible rings + aria labels on icon/toggle; reduced-motion fallback on waveform + theme transition; cyan reserved for the `live` waveform. (Full four-states/responsive audit lands with real screens Day 14.)
I. Regression: ✅ — re-verified Day-0 health endpoints (web `/api/health` ok) and full typecheck/lint/test/build across all 9 packages; `cn`/`tokens` exports preserved.
J. Quality/docs: ✅ — strict TS, no `any`/`!`; linter/formatter clean; BUILD-LOG + `.env.example` updated; component intent documented.
K. Build/CI: ✅ all green (typecheck 9/9, lint 9/9, test 3/3, build 7/7; voice pyright/ruff/pytest green).

Fixes applied this audit: exactOptionalPropertyTypes on Sentry `environment` (4 sites); CSS `@import` ordering; biome ignore for `.venv`/`__pycache__`/`.turbo`; removed v9-only Sentry export; env-overridable host ports after a local port collision.
Open/deferred: container image scan + Dependabot (no images yet); Storybook/visual-regression (Day 14+) — both intentional, logged above.
Proactive suggestions: add branch protection on `main` requiring the three CI jobs once `workflow` scope lands; install Python 3.12 locally before Day 7 (voice wheels).

**Post-merge addendum (Day 01):**
- **GitHub `workflow` scope** was missing from the account token, blocking any push touching `.github/workflows/`. Resolved by `gh auth refresh -s workflow` (device flow) + clearing a stale osxkeychain token so git uses the refreshed one. The repo had two git credential helpers (osxkeychain then gh) — documented for future reference.
- **First CI run was red; two config fixes landed (commit `f7284aa`):** (1) removed `version: 10` from `pnpm/action-setup` — it conflicted with `packageManager` in package.json (`ERR_PNPM_BAD_PM_VERSION`); (2) replaced `gitleaks-action` (PR commit-range detection failed with "unknown revision") with a direct `gitleaks git` history scan — deterministic + gitignore-aware (ignores `.next/` build output that tripped a tree scan). **Second run: all 3 jobs green** (node 2m36s, voice 17s, security 6s). PR #1 squash-merged.
- **History note:** Day 0's commits (`0ac2528`, `2091c5b`) were never pushed to the remote (they carried the placeholder workflow file and hit the same scope block), so remote `main` was just the initial commit. GitHub's squash-merge therefore folded Day 0 **and** Day 1 into one commit (`46c2dd9`). **All content is intact** (verified: every Day-0 + Day-1 file present, typecheck/lint/test/build green on `main`); only the Day-0/Day-1 commit boundary is cosmetically merged. No force-push/history rewrite attempted — content correctness over commit cosmetics.
- **Recommend next session:** enable branch protection on `main` requiring the `node` / `voice` / `security` checks now that they're green and pushable.
